# ML Tests (ML Lab)
A basic project testing out various techniques from machine learning, exploring both supervised and unsupervised methods. For all code basic university-course frameworks have been used, while (for the techniques) relevant parts have been reasoned and implemented alone.
For this, Python has been utilized, mostly using the libraries NumPy and SciPy.

## Unsupervised Learning
P1 and P2 go in depth on the following topics:
* PCA (Principal component analysis)
* Outlier Detection
* LLE (Local linear embedding)
* K-Means clustering

## Supervised Learning
P3 and P4 consist of tests with:
* KRR (Kernel ridge regression)
* Cross-Validation
* SVM (Support vector machines)
* Neural Networks
